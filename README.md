# Martyrs Records Management System
 Data Structure Third project 
 
 This project offers a comprehensive system for managing and honoring the legacy of martyrs. It utilizes a unique combination of data structures to ensure efficient storage, retrieval, and modification of martyr records, all within a user-friendly interface.

Core Technologies:

Circular Double Linked List: This structure provides efficient navigation through location records, allowing quick access to specific locations containing martyrs.

Binary Search Trees (BSTs): Martyrs within each location are organized using two BSTs. One sorts martyrs alphabetically for easy identification. The other utilizes a stack structure within each tree node, grouping martyrs who perished on the same date, fostering a powerful way to remember shared sacrifices.

Sorting and Searching Algorithms: The system implements efficient sorting and searching algorithms to locate specific martyrs by name or date with minimal time complexity. This ensures swift retrieval of information, honoring the memory of each martyr.

User-Friendly Interface:

The system prioritizes usability through a well-designed interface. Users can effortlessly:

Modify Location Records: Add, edit, or delete information about locations where martyrs fell.

Manage Martyr Records: Create, update, or delete individual martyr entries.

Search Martyrs: Employ fast and easy search methods to locate martyrs by name or date of martyrdom.

Static Interface for Tree Visualization: The interface includes a dedicated section that displays the content of both BSTs in separate text areas. This provides a real-time view of the data structure, including the current height of each tree and other relevant 
attributes. This transparency allows users to understand how martyrs are organized and facilitates debugging if needed.

Focus on Efficiency:

By utilizing carefully chosen data structures and optimized algorithms, the system achieves exceptional performance in both time and space complexity. This translates to:

Fast Searches: Locate martyrs with minimal delay, ensuring smooth user experience.
Reduced Memory Footprint: The system stores data efficiently, minimizing resource consumption.
